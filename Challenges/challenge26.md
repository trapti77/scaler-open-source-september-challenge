## Welcome to Challenge 26

Welcome to the 26th Challenge 


First of all, in order to continue with the entire open source wave, we are organizing an open source hackathon: Scaler OpenQuest hackathon: https://www.scaler.com/event/scaler-openquest-hackathon/, our recommendation is to participate in it.

You can participate in teams or individually. But we highly recommend participating in teams. Even if you don't know a lot of tech stack, we will still recommend to participate, learn some tech stack and then participate. You will take part in this and build open source projects. 

Contributions to the hackathon can be counted towards Hacktoberfest as well. 

So our recommendation is do take part in the hackathon, build some cool projects based on the problem statements we will provide :)

For team, you can invite someone you know outside the Discord community as well or look for partners in the server in the #openquest-hackathon forum channel under find your partners. 

We are really focusing on helping all of you in your journey towards Open Source so we would highly appreciate if you participate in the hackathon.


## Task
So today's task is: 
1. We recommend to register for the hackathon on this link , and start to look for team mates and fill the Google form:  https://forms.gle/j9CwsfDitUtKahaV7 once you have found your team to register it for the hackathon. 

2. 
This is a continuation of the 25th Challenge: https://github.com/scaleracademy/scaler-open-source-september-challenge/blob/main/Challenges/challenge25.md

So continue to look out for open source issues, and contribute. 

Task: 
At the end of the day, comment on the issue created in previous challenges with the update you have made in today's challenge. Whether you are still looking for issues or you may have found one, requested for yourself to get assigned to it and started working on it. Or you are struggling to understand what to do. Just update on the issue and continue to explore. Open source doesn't come easy. It will take time and you have to be patient. So just update on where you are on your journey of contributing to open source projects! 

If you have already made any contributions do share those with others in the Discord, or even try to create open source projects with collaboration with others.
