Today is the second and final part of this challenge: 

Task: 
1. Navigate to your Pull Request (PR) created in previous challenges.You will notice that your PR has a conflict, indicated with a message similar to the one shown below: <img width="636" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19529592/190574995-0cc506a8-a2fe-4aa4-98bd-4658e8aa2fc1.png">


2. Try to resolve this merge conflict using local git
- Open the conflicted file(s) in your code editor. Git will mark the conflicting sections.

- Manually edit the file to resolve the conflict by choosing which changes to keep.

- Save the file.

- Stage the resolved files by running `git add` after you have edited the files.

- Commit the changes with a message that indicates you've resolved the conflict.

- Push the changes to your remote repository.

3. Once resolved, share screenshot on the github issue created in the previous challenges
