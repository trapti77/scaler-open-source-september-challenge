## Welcome to Challenge 27

Welcome to the 27th Challenge 


Reminder: 
First of all, in order to continue with the entire open source wave, we are organizing an open source hackathon: Scaler OpenQuest hackathon: https://www.scaler.com/event/scaler-openquest-hackathon/, our recommendation is to participate in it.

You can participate in teams or individually. But we highly recommend participating in teams. Even if you don't know a lot of tech stack, we will still recommend to participate, learn some tech stack and then participate. You will take part in this and build open source projects. 

Contributions to the hackathon can be counted towards Hacktoberfest as well. 

So our recommendation is do take part in the hackathon, build some cool projects based on the problem statements we will provide :)

For team, you can invite someone you know outside the Discord community as well or look for partners in the server in the #openquest-hackathon forum channel under find your partners. 

We are really focusing on helping all of you in your journey towards Open Source so we would highly appreciate if you participate in the hackathon.

Clone the Repository locally:

Clone this repository repository to your local development environment using git clone.


Steps: 
1. In this local cloned repository
2. Create two branches: branchA and branchB.
3. Make several commits on branchA with different changes.
4. Select specific commits from branchA and apply them to branchB using the git cherry-pick command.
5. Resolve any conflicts that may arise during the cherry-picking process.
6. Once you have successfully cherry-picked the desired commits, push the changes to the remote repository.
7. Share screenshot of the cherry-picked commits in the issue created in previous challenges.
