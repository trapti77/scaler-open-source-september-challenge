## Welcome to Challenge 19

Welcome to the 19th Challenge!


### Brief Overview
In this challenge, we will dive into the world of GitHub Codespaces, a powerful tool for development and collaboration. GitHub Codespaces allows you to code and build in an online environment, making it easier to collaborate on projects and work from anywhere.

## Task:
1. Set Up a GitHub Codespace:

 - If you haven't already, create a GitHub repository or use an existing one that you'd like to work on.

- Navigate to the repository's main page on GitHub.

2. Create a Codespace:

 - Click on the "Code" button on the repository's main page.
 - Select the option to "Open with Codespaces."
 - Select the option to "New codespace."
 - Wait for your Codespace to be created.

3. Explore the Codespace:

- Once your Codespace is ready, explore its features and capabilities.
- Familiarize yourself with the development environment, including code editing, terminal access, and integrated tools.
- If you're new to Codespaces, check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace) for more information.
- If you're already familiar with Codespaces, try out some of the features you haven't used before.

4. Make a Change:

- In your Codespace, make a simple code change to a file in your repository.
- Create a new branch, make a code edit, and commit the change.

5. Push Your Changes:

- Push the changes back to your GitHub repository from within your Codespace.
- Confirm that the changes are reflected in your GitHub repository.

6. Share Your Experience:

- In the GitHub issue created in Challenge 1, share your experience with GitHub Codespaces. Mention any features you found useful, challenges you encountered, and how you envision using Codespaces in your development workflow. 


By completing this challenge, you'll gain hands-on experience with GitHub Codespaces and discover its potential for enhancing your development workflow and collaboration with others. In fact a lot of you are also facing issues with your local Git, try solving the Open Source September Challenge with Codespaces. That is, try to create a Codespace for your forked repository and explore if that helps with any of the challenges where you are stuck.
