## Welcome to Challenge 30


First of all, in order to continue with the entire open source wave, we are organizing an open source hackathon: Scaler OpenQuest hackathon: https://www.scaler.com/event/scaler-openquest-hackathon/, our recommendation is to participate in it.

You can participate in teams or individually. But we highly recommend participating in teams. Even if you don't know a lot of tech stack, we will still recommend to participate, learn some tech stack and then participate. You will take part in this and build open source projects. 

Contributions to the hackathon can be counted towards Hacktoberfest as well. 

So our recommendation is do take part in the hackathon, build some cool projects based on the problem statements we will provide :)

For team, you can invite someone you know outside the Discord community as well or look for partners in the server in the #openquest-hackathon forum channel under find your partners. 

We are really focusing on helping all of you in your journey towards Open Source so we would highly appreciate if you participate in the hackathon.
